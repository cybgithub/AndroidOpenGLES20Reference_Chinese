##Parameters

- ***pname*** Specifies the parameter value to be returned. The symbolic constants in the list below are accepted.

- ***params***
Returns the value or values of the specified parameter.

###Description

These four commands return values for simple state variables in GL. pname is a symbolic constant indicating the state variable to be returned, and params is a pointer to an array of the indicated type in which to place the returned data.

Type conversion is performed if params has a different type than the state variable value being requested. If glGetBooleanv is called, a floating-point (or integer) value is converted to GL_FALSE if and only if it is 0.0 (or 0). Otherwise, it is converted to GL_TRUE. If glGetIntegerv is called, boolean values are returned as GL_TRUE or GL_FALSE, and most floating-point values are rounded to the nearest integer value. Floating-point colors and normals, however, are returned with a linear mapping that maps 1.0 to the most positive representable integer value and -1.0 to the most negative representable integer value. If glGetFloatv is called, boolean values are returned as GL_TRUE or GL_FALSE, and integer values are converted to floating-point values.
